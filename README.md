# Virus Survival

### HEADS UP
This gamemode is very old and very bad.  
It hardly works and I had almost no experience doing anything of this scale at the time of creation.  
I can't recommend you actually use this on a server unless you do some serious revising.  
I probably won't be improving it any time soon.

### What is it?
Virus Survival is a gamemode based on GMod Tower Virus, which in turn is based on Timesplitters, mashed with weapons from Zombie Survival.

### How do I use it?
Download the whole thing and put the VirusSurvival folder into your addons folder.  You still need to send connecting clients the workshop version of the gamemode, because it contains some sounds and materials that I won't upload here.

### What can I do with it?
I'm not gonna officially stick a license on it because I don't care that much, but you can modify it however you want, but please don't upload it to the workshop.

### What else does this need?
You'll need to send the content of these addons to your connecting clients for them to hear anything properly:

The server itself needs these for the gamemode to work properly:
